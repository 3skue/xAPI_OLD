## Introduction

xAPI is a tool to run exploit functions without actually using Roblox exploits. It can do basically do anything you can do with pricey, risky programs, including:
- Hooking functions,
- Rawmetatable magic,
- and an integrated File System

all within the Roblox ecosystem!

## Installation

In order to install xAPI, put [the module](https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/asset/15278579028/xAPI-Source) somewhere and put the following code in the script you want to use it in:
```lua
require(<path to xAPI>)()
```
The Globals will automatically load in, and you're finished!
