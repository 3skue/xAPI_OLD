## Introduction

xAPI is an open source tool to simulate Roblox exploit functions, such as `hookfunction`, `getrawmetatable` and more.

## Usage

In order to use xAPI, put this code in the script:

```lua
require(game.ReplicatedStorage.xAPI)()
```
That's pretty much it! The Globals will automatically load in.
